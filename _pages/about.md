Hi! I'm Ryan, a Software Engineer Intern at Instagram in Menlo Park, California.

I have done 4 internships in software engineering - working in Big Tech at Meta and Tableau, in a unicorn start up at Visier, and in a research environment at UBC (NSERC USRA).

I am a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UBC Vancouver, with a 97% average and 4.00 GPA. (Top 1%)

I enjoy teaching - having taught 6 different courses over 9 semesters at UBC.

I am experienced in C++, Hack/PHP, Java, Python, and SQL.

I am interested in solving the most challenging technical problems while positively impacting the world.
